# Break-Bricks


**Game - brick breaker**
Stones, a ball and a bottom appear on the game board.
the Purpose of the game:
Break all the stones with the ball without the ball falling down.

**the progress of the game:**
The game starts when the player starts to move the ball with the arrows: left and right. 
The ball is thrown and starts breaking stones, all the stones in its vicinity. Each breaking of a stone gives 5 points. 
When there are no stones around to break, it lands down. The player has to move the bottom with the ball for the ball to hit it. 
If he hits her - he jumps and goes up again to break stones. Otherwise - it's a disqualification.

**End of the game:**
When the ball missed the bottom, that means the player is disqualified.
Or when the player finished breaking all the stones - and he won!


A fun game!
